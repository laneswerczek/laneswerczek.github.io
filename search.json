    "text": "The 2020 NCAA tournament never happend because of covid.\nThe charts show who would have the best odds to win the tournament.\nThe first chart show is a scatter plot chart showing srs which is the simple rating system.

It shows Gonzaga had the best offense with a good defense. But, they had an easy schedule.\nSince there are teams with easy schedules, the next chart which is a stacked bar chart is going to show the top 16 teams with the best srs and show their strength of schedules.\n\n\nCode\ntop16 &lt;- bball |&gt; \n top_n(16, wt=OverallSRS\n     )\nkansas &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Kansas\"\n  )\nmichst &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Michigan State\"\n  )\nbaylor &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Baylor\"\n  )\n\narizona &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Arizona\"\n  )\nduke &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Duke\"\n  )\nsanst &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"San Diego State\"\n  )\narizona &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Arizona\"\n  )\ndayton &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Dayton\"\n  )\ngonzaga &lt;- top16 |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School == \"Gonzaga\"\n  )\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top16, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=kansas, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#0051ba\") +\n  geom_bar(data=michst, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#18453B\") +\n  geom_bar(data=baylor, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#154734\") +\n  geom_bar(data=arizona, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#BF0A30\") +\n  geom_bar(data=duke, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#003087\") +\n  geom_bar(data=sanst, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#000000\") +\n  geom_bar(data=dayton, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#CE1141\") +\n  geom_bar(data=gonzaga, aes(x=reorder(School,OverallSOS), weight = OverallSOS), fill = \"#041E42\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Strength of Schedule\", \n    title=\"These are the top eight teams that could win.\", \n    subtitle=\"Kansas had the hardest strength of schedule with Gonzaga having the easiest.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Basketball | By Lane Swerczek\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eight hilighted teams are going to be the teams in the hypothetical elite eight. Gonzaga, Dayton, and San Diego State all were good, but they have terrible strength of schedules. So in the hypothetical final four is going to be Kansas, Gonzaga, Dayton and Baylor.\nThe final chart is a dumbell chart with the hypothetical final four. With this chart it takes a look on the Kenpom website looking at their net rankings and their opponents net rankings.\n\n\nCode\nken &lt;- read.csv(\"Spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=ken, \n    aes(y=Team, x=NetRtg, xend=SOSNetRtg),\n     size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"KenPom Net Ratings vs Opponent Net Ratings\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"The top four teams who could win it all.\", \n    subtitle=\"In the Dumbell chart it shows the top four teams netrankings.

National chapionship with Kansas winning it.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Kenpom | By Lane Swerczek\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith looking at that Kansas and Baylor are the teams that would be in the national championship because they are the top two teams. They played twice in the season with Baylor winning the first game 67-55 and in the second game Kansas won 64-61 and if they played a third time in the championship Kansas would win. No ones knows who would of won the 2020 national championship, but a high chance it would be Kansas or Baylor."

    "text": "The natianal player of the year goes to the best player in the country. There has been some good players that have won national player of the since 2019. They all had outstanding seaons and it’s hard to tell who was better out of the seven of them. Some of them were better on offense and others were better on defense.\nFans always debate who the best player is or if that player should have even won national player of the year. So we are going to look at three designs and see who is the best or is it to close to tell and have debates like Michael Jordan and Lebron James.\nFirst we look at who has the best TS% and USG% out of the seven national player of year to see who had the ball the most in their hands and who shot the ball well.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nplayers19 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2019) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers20 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2020) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers21 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2021) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers22 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2022) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers23 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2023) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers24 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players24.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2024) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\nplayers25 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_basketball_players25.csv\") |&gt; mutate(season_end = 2025) |&gt; mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season_end))\n\nplayers &lt;- bind_rows(players19, players20, players21, players22, players23, players24, players25) \n\ncf &lt;- players25 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Cooper Flagg\")\nze &lt;- players24 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zach Edey\")\nze1 &lt;- players23 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zach Edey\")\not &lt;- players22 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Oscar Tshiebwe\")\nlg &lt;- players21 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Luka Garza\")\not1 &lt;- players20 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Obi Toppin\")\nzw &lt;- players19 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Zion Williamson\")\n\npoy &lt;- bind_rows(cf, zw, ze, ze1, ot, lg, ot1)\n\npoyseasons &lt;- players |&gt; filter(Player %in% poy$Player)\n\n\nplayerplot &lt;- players |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt; 750)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=playerplot, aes(x= `TS%`, y=`USG%`), color = \"light grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=poy, aes(x=`TS%`, y=`USG%`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=poy, aes(x=`TS%`, y= `USG%`, label=PlayerSeason)) + labs(\n    x=\"TS%\", \n    y=\"USG%\", \n    title=\"Which player had the highest USG% and TS%?\", \n    subtitle=\"2019 Zion Williamson has the highest TS% and 2023 Zach Edey has the highest USG%.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Ncaa Mens Basketball | By Lane Swerczek\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see everyones TS% is over 55% which is really good. But, Oscar Tshiebwe’s USG% is low why is that. He average over 15 rebounds a game so he didn’t have plays ran throught him, but I wouldn’t say that takes him out of the conversation as the best. TS% is more important I would say. So looking at the chart it looks like Zach Edey and Zion are the top two.\nNow we are going to take a look at a table and see which player has the best Z-score\n\n\nCode\nplayerszscore &lt;- players |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  group_by(season_end) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    pts_z = scale(PTS, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE),\n    usg_z = scale(`USG%`, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE),\n    reb_z = scale(TRB, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE),\n    Composite = pts_z + usg_z + reb_z\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(MP &gt; 750) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Composite)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  select(Team, Player, season_end, Composite) |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=Composite)\n\nplayerszscore |&gt; \n  select(Player, Team, season_end, Composite) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who has the best zscore?\",\n    subtitle = \"Luka Garza has the best zscore while Zack Edey is close behind.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lane Swerczek  |  **Source:** NCAA Mens Basketball\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#CFB991\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Zach Edey\")\n  )  |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#FFCD00\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Luka Garza\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0033A0\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Oscar Tshiebwe\")\n  )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has the best zscore?\n\n\nLuka Garza has the best zscore while Zack Edey is close behind.\n\n\nPlayer\nTeam\nseason_end\nComposite\n\n\n\n\nLuka Garza\nIowa Hawkeyes\n2021\n11.291563\n\n\nVonterius Woolbright\nWestern Carolina Catamounts Men's\n2024\n11.031007\n\n\nZach Edey\nPurdue Boilermakers Men's\n2023\n11.024462\n\n\nLamine Diane\nCal State Northridge Matadors\n2019\n10.634288\n\n\nMike Daum\nSouth Dakota State Jackrabbits\n2019\n10.281354\n\n\nFardaws Aimaq\nUtah Valley Wolverines\n2022\n10.141983\n\n\nTerry Taylor\nAustin Peay Governors\n2021\n9.904534\n\n\nOscar Tshiebwe\nKentucky Wildcats\n2022\n9.813471\n\n\nNathan Knight\nWilliam & Mary Tribe\n2020\n9.763951\n\n\nKofi Cockburn\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n2021\n9.526826\n\n\n\nBy: Lane Swerczek | Source: NCAA Mens Basketball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see out of the seven players only three of them are on here Luka Garza, Zach Edey, and Oscar Tshiebwe. Luka Garza is first with 11.03 and Zach Edey not for behind. So after this i would say that Zach Edey is the best.\nThe Last chart is a stacked bar chart where he see who had the biggest impact on defense. That includes Total rebounds, steals, and blocks.\n\n\nCode\npoypergame &lt;- poy |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    PPG = PTS / G,\n    AST =  AST / G,\n    Rebounds = TRB / G\n    \n  ) |&gt;\n  select(Season, Team, Player, PPG , AST, Rebounds)\n\nstackedpoy &lt;- poy |&gt; \n  group_by(PlayerSeason) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    TotalRebounds = sum(TRB),\n    Steals = sum(STL),\n    Blocks = sum(BLK)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(Hustle = TotalRebounds+Steals+Blocks) |&gt; \n  select(\n    PlayerSeason, Hustle, TotalRebounds, Steals, Blocks\n  ) |&gt; \n   pivot_longer(cols = c(-PlayerSeason, -Hustle), names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Number\") \n\ntshiebew &lt;- stackedpoy |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Oscar Tshiebwe 2022\")\n\nobi &lt;- stackedpoy |&gt; filter(PlayerSeason == \"Obi Toppin 2020\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=stackedpoy, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, Hustle), weight=Number, fill=Stat)) + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=tshiebew, aes(x=PlayerSeason, weight=Number, fill=Stat), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=obi, aes(x=PlayerSeason, weight=Number, fill=Stat), color=\"black\") +\n    labs(\n      x=\"\",\n      y=\"\",\n      title=\"Whos the better defensive player?\", \n      subtitle=\"Oscar Tshiebwe looks like he had the most impact on the defesive side. \", \n      caption=\"Source: NCAA Mens Basketball | By Lane Swerczek\") + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"yellow\"), labels=c(\"Blocks\",\"Steals\",\"TotalRebounds\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith looking at who had the most impact on defense it looks to be Oscar Tshiebwe because he had a ton of rebounds. Zion Williamson has the most blocks. And Zach Edey has the most blocks. So who is the best on the defensive side. Obi Toppin’s player of the year season was covid season so would he be higher than he is.\nSo after looking at all three charts I would have give it to 2023 Zach Edey. He is the only player that was high on every chart."
